    "First, a brief introduction to the Jupyter notebook. Notebooks are living documents that combine code with inline output and annotations, allowing you to perform your data analysis _with_ your writing. In this way, you can ensure that your written reports always reflect the latest work you've done, as well as ensuring that you (and your audience) always know what steps you took while performing your analysis. Notebooks are made up of three main types of cells: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown (used for general writing and annotation)\n",
    "- Code (used for writing code to be evaluated for computation or display purposes)\n",
    "- Output (generated by running code cells and displaying the result)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the type of a cell at any time by clicking the Cell Type button in the toolbar at the top of the notebook. (for new cells it says \"Code\", but can also say \"Markdown\" or \"Raw\"). The contents of a cell appear as plain, monospaced text until the cell is \"executed\". At that point, Jupyter processes the contents of the cell according to the cell type and outputs a result. To execute a cell, type <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. "

    "The variables created in a cell are available for use by any cell evaluated after that point. Notice I say _evaluated_, rather than _located_. It is possible to evaluate Jupyter notebooks out of order (_i.e.,_ you could evaluate a cell near the bottom of a notebook, then evaluate the second cell in a notebook and use the information calculated in that bottom cell). As you work through labs, you might be tempted to do this… I urge you to resist this temptation, as you might find that input variables are undefined, or equal to something unexpected. Similarly, if you open your Jupyter notebook later and try to run a code block in the middle, it may tell you that your variables are undefined, even though you can clearly see them defined in earlier code blocks. But if you didn’t _re-run_ those code blocks, then Python doesn’t know they exist.

    "Sometimes you will need to match something more complex than just a particular word or phrase in your output file. Sometimes you will need to match a particular word, but _only_ if it is found at the beginning of a line. Or perhaps you will need to match a particular pattern of data, like a capital letter followed by a number, but you won’t know the exact letter and number you are looking for. These types of matching situations are handled with something called regular expressions which is accessed through the Python module `re`. While using regular expressions (regexes) is outside the scope of this tutorial, they are _extremely_ useful and you might want to learn more about them in the future. An excellent tutorial can be found in the book [\"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" by Al Swigert](https://automatetheboringstuff.com). It is free to read on the linked site.
