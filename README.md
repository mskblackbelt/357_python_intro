# 357_python_intro

This repository contains an introduction to Python3 for students in Chem357 (Physical Chemistry Lab II). The materials were derived from tutorials created by [The Molecular Sciences Software Institute](https://molssi.org). For more information, see the attributions in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md). All data in the folder `data` are from the same source. 

The Jupyter notebook uses [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/), so you'll probably want to install the [jupyterlab_myst plugin](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-jupyter-lab-myst).
